# kittens: automatic type class derivation for Cats

**kittens** is a Scala library which provides instances of type classes from the [Cats][cats] library for arbitrary
algebraic data types using [shapeless][shapeless]-based automatic type class derivation.

kittens is part of the [Typelevel][typelevel] family of projects. It is an Open Source project under the Apache
License v2, hosted on [github][source]. Binary artefacts will be published to the [Sonatype OSS Repository Hosting
service][sonatype] and synced to Maven Central.

It is current in a pre-alpha state, but should be ready for an initial release in the very near future.
